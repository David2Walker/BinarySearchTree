The design of my binary search tree is as it was described in class.
It's pretty straight forward, not really sure what I'm suppose to be describing.
Insert - int is read in, then tree is traversed to proper location and node is inserted.
Delete - int is read in, tree is traversed, then transplant process is performed to rebuild tree.
the other methods continue is this straightforward explinations.
